    <p>
      Hi, my name is Emily and I love helping people and creating. With a formal education in molecular and cellular genetics, I started my career in healthcare in order 
      to make a difference in people's lives. After several years of laboratory work analyzing genetic changes associated with blood cancers, I grew frustrated with the 
      user interfaces and data storage programs available to the specialized laboratory technician. In a healthcare laboratory setting, patient data, lab procedures, and 
      test results must be defined and stored, in addition to being visible to the physician, in order to facilitate proper patient care. Working in a niche laboratory, 
      with different needs and types of testing than other labs, the available programs didn't work well for us. Creating and using our own programs and databases didn't 
      help much because they didn't interface with the physician side of things. <br /> <br />
      I quickly realized that while others were resigned to continue to do duplicate work because that “is just the way it is”, I knew, with the right skills, there was 
      an attainable solution to this problem. Thanks to a programming class in high school, I knew I liked coding and after deciding I no longer wished to shoulder the 
      emotional burden of a healthcare worker, I transitioned my career into web development. As a natural life-long learner, I am excited to see where my new career 
      trajectory takes me.
